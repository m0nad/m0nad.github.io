## Welcome to m0nad's Page :)

As a constant learner and explorer, I build, break or fix systems to acquire better knowledge about computer and information security.

### Open Source Projects

[Diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) - LKM rootkit for Linux Kernels 2.6.x/3.x/4.x/5.x (x86/x86_64 and ARM64).

[HellRaiser](https://github.com/m0nad/HellRaiser) - Vulnerability scanner using Nmap for scanning and correlating found CPEs with CVEs.

[DNS-Discovery](https://github.com/m0nad/DNS-Discovery) - Multithreaded subdomain brute-forcer meant to be used by pentesters during the initial stages of testing. It uses a wordlist that concatenates with a given domain to search for subdomains.

[Msfsuggester](https://github.com/m0nad/msfsuggester) - Metasploit exploit suggester using OpenVAS XML output.

[Awesome Privilege Escalation](https://github.com/m0nad/awesome-privilege-escalation) - A curated list of awesome privilege escalation.

[ARP-Poison](https://github.com/m0nad/ARP-Poison) - ARP-Poison - also known as an - ARP Spoofing tool.

[Blog](https://m0nadlabs.wordpress.com/) - Blog with some technical stuff.

And more! Check my [Github](https://github.com/m0nad)

### Open Source Contributions

[Nmap](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q4/132) - Patch to fix ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.nse script detection issue.

[Linux Kernel](https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/20/30) - Commit to the Linux Kernel fixing a memory leakage in clk-sunxi.c.

[PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz/pull/43) - Fix pcap type detection regex issue. [Patch](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz/pull/44) to call the correct pcap parsing function.

### Presentations
