## Welcome to m0nad's Page :)

As a constant learner and explorer, I build, break or fix systems to acquire better knowledge about computers and information security.

### Open Source Projects

[Diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine) - LKM rootkit for Linux Kernels 2.6.x/3.x/4.x/5.x (x86/x86_64 and ARM64).

[HellRaiser](https://github.com/m0nad/HellRaiser) - Vulnerability scanner using Nmap for scanning and correlating found CPEs with CVE.

[DNS-Discovery](https://github.com/m0nad/DNS-Discovery) - Multithreaded subdomain brute-forcer meant to be used by pentesters during the initial stages of testing. It uses a wordlist that concatenates with a given domain to search for subdomains.

[Msfsuggester](https://github.com/m0nad/msfsuggester) - Metasploit exploit suggester using OpenVAS XML output

[Awesome Privilege Escalation](https://github.com/m0nad/awesome-privilege-escalation) - A curated list of awesome privilege escalation.

[ARP-Poison](https://github.com/m0nad/ARP-Poison) - ARP-Poison - also known as an - ARP Spoofing tool.

[Blog](https://m0nadlabs.wordpress.com/) - Blog with some technical stuff.

And more! Check my [Github](https://github.com/m0nad)

### Open Source Contributions

[Nmap](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2014/q4/132) - Patch to fix ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.nse script detection issue.

[Linux Kernel](https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/20/30) - Commit to the Linux Kernel fixing a memory leakage in clk-sunxi.c.

### Presentations

[MBConf@home 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3MH0cIA0I) - Linux Local Privilege Escalation. Talk about the methodology, tips, and tricks on Linux privilege escalation.

[Alligator Conference 2019](https://www.alligatorcon.com/) - cLoWn 3steRlionate: mak1ng m0ney fr0m li3s. A presentation about how to crack small RSA keys in 50's seconds.

[NullByte Security Conference 2017](https://nullbyte-con.org/archive/2017/ninjas.html) - Diamorphine for today’s kernels. A presentation about how can we write a rootkit for current Linux kernels taking into account changes that happened in the kernel from the time of the LKM HACKING paper and the heroin.c code.

[Alligator Conference 2014](https://www.alligatorcon.com/) - Diamorphine for today’s kernels. A presentation about how can we write a rootkit for current Linux kernels taking into account changes that happened in the kernel from the time of the LKM HACKING paper and the heroin.c code.

[Alligator Conference 2012](https://www.alligatorcon.com) - Return-Oriented Programming. Presentation on the exploitation technique known as Return Oriented Programming, useful to circumvent protections like NX bit or Data Execution Prevention.

[First Tecland Meeting 2012](https://www.tecland.com.br/edicoes-anteriores/i-encontro-tecland-2/) - Buffer Overflows for dummies. A presentation about the exploitation of buffer overflows from the basics.

[First Tecland Meeting 2012](https://www.tecland.com.br/edicoes-anteriores/i-encontro-tecland-2/) - Building Shellcodes. Presentation on shellcode development, machine code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.
